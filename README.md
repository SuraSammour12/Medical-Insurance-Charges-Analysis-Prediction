# üè•üí∞ Medical Insurance Charges Analysis & Prediction
This project focuses on performing data analytics and predictive modeling on a medical insurance cost dataset. The main objective is to analyze how personal attributes like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region influence insurance charges, and to develop regression models to predict these charges.

# Project Objectives
Load the data as a Pandas DataFrame.

Clean the dataset and handle any missing or blank entries.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting charges.

Develop:

Single Variable Linear Regression Model.

Multiple Variable Linear Regression Model.

Apply Ridge Regression to refine model performance and reduce overfitting.
